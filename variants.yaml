# variants.yaml — build matrix for wv-forge packages
# rattler-build reads this file via -m flag to expand recipes into multiple builds.
#
# Usage:
#   rattler-build build -r <recipe> -m conda_forge_pinning.yaml -m variants.yaml
#
# This produces: 2 Python x 3 CUDA = 6 variants per CUDA package.
# Noarch packages should use --ignore-recipe-variants to skip this matrix.

# rattler-build errors if both channel_sources (from -m config) and -c flags are set,
# so variant builds rely on this instead of -c flags.
